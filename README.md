# DH-Assignment-07-High-Fidelity-Prototype
## Brief Description of the Project
I felt inspired by the Zero Hunger Project to improve the student needs and resources from my alma mater community college, College of the Desert, by making it more user friendly and adding more features for the target audience to engage with. In this way, I hope that the features inform more people of the many resources like nutritional food that is available to them at a free cost.

## Purpose and Process of Interactive Prototype Phase
The purpose of the prototype is to solidify the foundation of the wireflow and how a user would interact with prototype--making sure to keep heuristics in mind (immediate feedback, error prevention, consistency, and etc). Most of my process started by referring back to my low fidelity prototype, user persona/scenarios, and checking the interface design system. 

## Tasks
### Feature 1: Maps/Personal Stories/Adding to Calendar
This was derived from the first persona: Elaina Pascuela after an insightful contextual inquiry. 

> Main purpose: to find nearby food pantries with contact information and easily add it to the calendar with personal stories to show shy users how much this free resource has made an impact on their life.

- Map Navigation (with search bar by location) (Work in Progress to add the time filter function)
- Call Now
- Adding to calendar
- Personal Stories

### Feature 2: Reservation system
This was derived from the second persona: Jacob Mendoza after an insightful contextual inquiry. 
> Main purpose: to make the visit to the food pantry quickly and swiftly
- Reserving food items up to a certain amount
- Tags (Work in Progress - does not actually filter food items just yet.) 
- Selecting a pick up time with two methods: using the student ID or anonymous
