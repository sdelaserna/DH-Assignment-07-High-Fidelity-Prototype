# DH-Assignment-07-High-Fidelity-Prototype
## Brief Description of the Project
I felt inspired by the Zero Hunger Project to improve the student needs and resources from my alma mater community college, College of the Desert, by making it more user friendly and adding more features for the target audience to engage with. In this way, I hope that the features inform more people of the many resources like nutritional food that is available to them at a free cost.

## Purpose and Process of Interactive Prototype Phase
The purpose of the prototype is to solidify the foundation of the wireflow and how a user would interact with prototype--making sure to keep heuristics in mind (immediate feedback, error prevention, consistency, and etc). Most of my process started by referring back to my low fidelity prototype, user persona/scenarios, and checking the interface design system. 

## Tasks
### Feature 1: Maps/Personal Stories/Adding to Calendar
This was derived from the first persona: Elaina Pascuela after an insightful contextual inquiry. 

> Main purpose: to find nearby food pantries with contact information and easily add it to the calendar with personal stories to show shy users how much this free resource has made an impact on their life.

- Map Navigation (with search bar by location) | full screen and small screen!
> (Work in Progress to add the time filter function)
- Call Now
- Adding to calendar
- Personal Stories

### Feature 2: Reservation system
This was derived from the second persona: Jacob Mendoza after an insightful contextual inquiry. 
> Main purpose: to make the visit to the food pantry quickly and swiftly
- Reserving food items up to a certain amount
- Tags (Work in Progress - does not actually filter food items just yet.) 
- Selecting a pick up time with two methods: using the student ID or anonymous

## Wireflow

## Cognitive Walkthrough (1)
This cognitive walkthrough was done during class time on November 16, 2022. However, this cognitive walkthrough only had 1 task that was very roughly finished. Another cognitive walkthrough was conducted down below. 
### Summary of Findings
1. There was some struggle with the prototype because not all the icons and buttons had an interactivity yet. (Issues with back flow)
2. Belle suggested to add a bookmark feature so students can easily find their favorite food pantry. 
3. The personal stories should be pictures rather than smiley face icons because it could be mistaken as a rating system of the food pantry, rather than a testament of positive imapct. 
4. They thought the navigation animation was cool and would be enhanced with a basemap at the bottom. 
5. Issues with the buttons flickering back and forth. (This is fixed now.)
6. Suggested to have maps and personal stories on different frames. Too text heavy for their liking. 
### Process
I followed the Cognitive Walkthrough guidline that was on the Google form from class. We did a quick impression test in the beginning. Both Maham and Belle were able to understand that the web/app was for food resources. They wish that there was a better measurement if progress is being made towards their goal. There was also an emphasis to make the buttons bigger so that people don't actually press on the wrong one and it would take them to wrong page. I made sure to ask follow up questions when all of these comments were said and made note of it for my next design iteration.

### Reflection
#### What I would change/design differently
It was nice having an outside perspective run through the prototype because as the person who designed the system, I already have a predetermined way to interact with it because I know in the back of my head where it's supposed to go. With the cognitive walkthrough it was a fresh take and allowed me to check if the system matches and is consistent with their internal workign model. From this cognitive walkthrough, I polished the first feature and completed the second feature as well. I would still like to design the calendar differently, but due to time constraints, energy management, and personal matters, I was not able to have it cross platform with Apple Calendar or Google Calendar. I think I will go back to work on this project in a later date to learn more about it.
